Description: Methods for dividing data into subsets, applying analytical
    methods to the subsets, and recombining the results.  Comes with a generic
    MapReduce interface as well.  Works with key-value pairs stored in memory,
    on local disk, or on HDFS, in the latter case using the R and Hadoop
    Integrated Programming Environment (RHIPE).  Also includes experimental
    support for key-value pairs stored as Spark RDDs using the SparkR package.
