\usage{
mrExec(data, setup = NULL, map = NULL, reduce = NULL, output = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE, control = NULL, params = NULL, packages = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a ddo/ddf object, or list of ddo/ddf objects}

\item{setup}{an expression of R code (created using the R command \code{expression}) to be run before map and reduce}

\item{map}{an R expression that is evaluated during the map stage. For each task, this expression is executed multiple times (see details).}

\item{reduce}{a vector of R expressions with names pre, reduce, and post that is evaluated during the reduce stage. For example \code{reduce = expression(pre = {...}, reduce = {...}, post = {...})}. reduce is optional, and if not specified the map output key-value pairs will be the result. If it is not specified, then a default identity reduce is performed. Setting it to 0 will skip the reduce altogether.}

\item{output}{a "kvConnection" object indicating where the output data should reside (see \code{\link{localDiskConn}}, \code{\link{hdfsConn}}).  If \code{NULL} (default), output will be an in-memory "ddo" object.  If a character string, it will be treated as a path to be passed to the same type of connection as \code{data} - relative paths will be relative to the working directory of that back end.}

\item{overwrite}{logical; should existing output location be overwritten? (also can specify \code{overwrite = "backup"} to move the existing output to _bak)}

\item{control}{parameters specifying how the backend should handle things (most-likely parameters to \code{rhwatch} in RHIPE) - see \code{\link{rhipeControl}} and \code{\link{localDiskControl}}}

\item{params}{a named list of objects external to the input data that are needed in the map or reduce phases}

\item{packages}{a vector of R package names that contain functions used in \code{fn} (most should be taken care of automatically such that this is rarely necessary to specify)}

\item{verbose}{logical - print messages about what is being done}
}
\value{
"ddo" object - to keep it simple.  It is up to the user to update or cast as "ddf" if that is the desired result.
