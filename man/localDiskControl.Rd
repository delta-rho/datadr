\title{Specify Control Parameters for MapReduce on a Local Disk Connection}
\usage{
localDiskControl(cluster = NULL, map_buff_size_bytes = 10485760,
  reduce_buff_size_bytes = 10485760, map_temp_buff_size_bytes = 10485760)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster}{a "cluster" object obtained from \code{\link{makeCluster}} to allow for parallel processing}

\item{map_buff_size_bytes}{determines how much data should be sent to each map task}

\item{reduce_buff_size_bytes}{determines how much data should be sent to each reduce task}

\item{map_temp_buff_size_bytes}{determines the size of chunks written to disk in between the map and reduce}
}
\description{
Specify control parameters for a MapReduce on a local disk connection.  Currently the parameters include:
}
\note{
If you have data on a shared drive that multiple nodes can access or a high performance shared file system like Lustre, you can run a local disk MapReduce job on multiple nodes by creating a multi-node cluster with \code{\link{makeCluster}}.

If you are using multiple cores and the input data is very small, \code{map_buff_size_bytes} needs to be small so that the key-value pairs will be split across cores.
