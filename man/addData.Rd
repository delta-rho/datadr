\title{Add Key-Value Pairs to a Data Connection}
\usage{
addData(conn, data, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{a kvConnection object}

\item{data}{a list of key-value pairs (list of lists where each sub-list has two elements, the key and the value)}

\item{overwrite}{if data with the same key is already present in the data, should it be overwritten? (does not work for HDFS connections)}
}
\description{
Add key-value pairs to a data connection
}
\note{
This is generally not recommended for HDFS as it writes a new file each time it is called, and can result in more individual files than Hadoop likes to deal with.
